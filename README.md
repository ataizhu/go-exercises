# Go Exercises

I'm using this repository to document my journey learning the Go programming language through the exercises on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/go).

Each folder contains a single exercise, including my solution, the tests provided by Exercism, and the accompanying learning materials.

Working through these challenges has been a great way to explore Go's standard library, idioms, and tooling while building up practical experience in the language.
